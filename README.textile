Javascript_named_routes is a Rails plugin I created to expose the named routes in your application as JavaScript functions on the client side. Setting it up is a ridiculously easy 3-step process -

* <code>script/plugin install git://github.com/sentientholon/javascript_named_routes.git</code>
* add <code>map.javascript_named_routes</code> to your routes.rb
* add <code><%= javascript_named_routes %></code> to your view layouts

That's it.

So, let's say your application has a standard User resource. That means you already have some URL helpers available to your application: <code>users_path</code>, <code>user_path</code>, <code>edit_user_path</code>, etc. With javascript_named_routes, you can now access these from JavaScript, like so -

* <code>Routes.usersPath()</code> => <code>/users</code>
* <code>Routes.userPath(123)</code> => <code>/users/123</code>
* <code>Routes.userPath({id: 123})</code> - or, as an object! => <code>/users/123</code>

*_Note that in the most recent version, function names have been camelized relative to their Ruby names, to be more consistent with JavaScript naming conventions._*

Routes with multiple placeholders work the same way - you can either pass them as positional parameters, where they'll be placed into the URL from left-to-right, or you can pass a JavaScript object containing the keys from the route string. For example, the named route:

* <code>map.show_account, '/account/:last_name/:first_name', :controller => 'accounts', :action => 'show'</code>

Can be accessed as either -

* <code>Routes.showAccountPath('Doe', 'John')</code> => <code>/account/Doe/John</code>, or
* <code>Routes.showAccountPath({first_name: 'John', last_name: 'Doe'})</code> => <code>/account/Doe/John</code>

Finally, extra parameters not specified by the route will be placed in the URL query string -

* <code>Routes.showAccountPath('{first_name: 'John', last_name: 'Doe', age: 42})</code> => <code>/account/Doe/John?age=42</code>.

In fact, positional and keyword parameters can be freely mixed -

* <code>Routes.userPath(123, {age: 42})</code> => <code>/users/123?age=42</code>

*_Please Note: The handling of the <code>format</code> parameter has changed in Rails 2.3!  If you need the pre-2.3 functionality, you need to install the rails_2_2 branch:_*

* <code>script/plugin install git://github.com/sentientholon/javascript_named_routes.git -r rails_2_2</code>

Enjoy!
